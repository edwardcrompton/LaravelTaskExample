Extended Task List
==================

This is based on the intermediate Laravel tutorial here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/quickstart-intermediate

This includes the following additional features not in the example:
* The ability to edit an existing task
* An unauthenticated REST API endpoint that allows us to create tasks assigned to user 1.
* The ability to send an email using Mailgun when a task is created

Future features might include:
* Authentication for the API using a key and secret
* Validation to ensure the REST API is being used correctly.
